🧠 What is the Project?
A Weather Web App that:

Lets users check current weather and 3-day forecast for any city.

Uses GPS auto-detection to show your local weather.

Has a modern food-style UI, responsive design, and dark/light theme toggle.

🧰 Technologies Used:
Tech	Purpose
HTML5	Structure of the webpage
CSS3	Styling with a warm “food” theme
JavaScript	App logic, API calls, DOM manipulation
WeatherAPI	Real-time weather data via HTTP requests
Geolocation API	Gets current location of the user

└── script.js      ← Logic: fetch, render, GPS, forecast
🚧 Breakdown of Each Part:
1. HTML (Structure)
input field to enter a city name.

Buttons:

🔍 Search Weather

📍 Use Current Location

🌗 Toggle Dark/Light Mode

div sections to display:

Weather icon + temperature + description

Wind, humidity

3-day forecast using forecastday[]

IDs used in HTML to access via JavaScript (#temp, #weatherIcon, #forecast).

2. CSS (Design - Food Style UI)
Gradient background for warmth 🍲.

Rounded cards and shadows for modern feel.

Dark mode toggle using .dark-mode class on body.

Responsive layout (fits mobile & desktop).

Soft colors, hover effects on buttons.

3. JavaScript (Functionality & Logic)
a. 📡 Weather API Integration
We use:

js
Copy
Edit
https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=API_KEY&q=LOCATION&days=3
LOCATION can be a city name or GPS coordinates.

Response includes:

location: name, country

current: temp, humidity, wind, condition

forecast.forecastday: next 3 days’ forecast

b. 🔍 Get Weather by City
js
Copy
Edit
function getWeather() {
  const city = document.getElementById("cityInput").value;
  const url = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=${apiKey}&q=${city}&days=3&aqi=yes`;
  fetchWeather(url);
}
c. 📍 Auto-location Weather
js
Copy
Edit
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
  const { latitude, longitude } = position.coords;
  const url = `https://api.weatherapi.com/v1/forecast.json?key=${apiKey}&q=${latitude},${longitude}&days=3`;
  fetchWeather(url);
});
d. 🛠️ Main Fetch Logic
js
Copy
Edit
function fetchWeather(url) {
  fetch(url)
    .then(res => res.json())
    .then(data => {
      // show weather and forecast
    })
    .catch(err => console.error(err));
}
e. 🌗 Theme Toggle
js
Copy
Edit
document.getElementById("themeBtn").addEventListener("click", () => {
  document.body.classList.toggle("dark-mode");
});
💡 Features to Talk About in Interviews:

✅ How to Explain to Interviewer:
You can say something like:

“I built a weather app that uses WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather and forecast data. Users can check weather by entering a city name or by using their current location through the browser’s Geolocation API. I handled async requests using fetch and dynamically updated the DOM to show weather conditions, icons, temperature, humidity, and forecast. I added a theme toggle and responsive UI, keeping accessibility and modern design in mind.”
